# Thoughts on pitch project for the worldmusictextbook.org

## Pitch

* Importance of accuracy is a value judgement that differs in different settings, even in one place (Birthday song vs symphony orchestra stage)
* Mathematics and minor adjustments for reasons that are not "natural" (despite claims of naturalness), including equal temperament and Greek history
* Organization in scales and modes

### Notes vs pitches

* Frequency as measurements for pitch (with interactive)
* Description of overtone system with link to the interactive could be useful here
* Notes as meaningful pitch levels within a relational system, or maybe sounds that have length, placement, relationships to other sounds, etc

### Pitch manipulations

* Modifying the pitch of a sound to create dramatic or emotive expression, for example (other types? complexity?)
* Ornaments:
  * Scoop into a pitch, fall away from a pitch
  * Others that make use of rhythms or other textures

### Negotiating mathematics and reality

* Greek system of ratios (briefly)
* Building a scale
* Tuning systems: just, equal, gamelan (with interactive that allows for random and a visual showing relationship)
* Cultural/historical/social importance of some of these relationships, like equal coming out of a need to play in multiple keys, demonstrates a negotiation between a (social) ideal of perfection and a compositional aspiration toward completeness, for example
* Valuing participation: Happy Birthday

### Pitches vs motion

* A set of pitches (scale) used at random vs a collection of related pitches that carry expectations in terms of melodic development and motion (interactive with randomized pitches vs a maqam performance)
* This sense of mode is not unique to other places (India, Middle East), it defines how we conceptualize major and minor

## Texture

* Odetta, Moses, Moses as example of multiple melody

## Part 1: Expectation and repetition

So much of music is about expectation. People who make music set us listeners up by following "rules" that are not really rules. They are expectations. When music does something different from what we have heard so many times before, it can be confusing. It can be exciting. It can also be surprising, fulfilling, and so on. Yet, these same sensations can come out of music that fulfils, instead of breaking from, our expectations.

This pair of essays considers the idea of rhythm in terms of expectation, ambiguity, and experience. Music is something that we feel as much as we hear (TODO: cite). It impacts us, in part, through how we sense it, not just how we hear or think about it. Centering this idea, I introduce some ideas about how rhythm works broadly. This first essay is about how patterns and the repetition of cycles can organize time. The second one looks more closely at how we can hear and feel smaller divisions and manipulations of time. While I don't discuss the ideas directly, these essays are also both about intensity and creativity.

While rhythm applies to all sorts of music and sound, it's common to consider it foremost in terms of drumming or percussion. Depending on what you listen to—your musical experiences and expectations—a drumming pattern can be confusing, boring, groovy, exciting, and so on. Here is a common rock beat. Thanks to the globalizing tendencies of the music industry, this is a familiar sound for many people across the world (TODO cite).

Many things come together to impact how you might hear and feel this pattern.

1. If you have heard specific styles of popular music before, then it may sound familiar. That does not mean that you have words to describe it or have every listened and said "Oh, I know that drum pattern, I've heard it before!" This is an example of how things like globalization, memory, nostalgia, and culture play out in listening. If someone remembers her parents listening to a certain artist or type of music (like [1950s country](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjCoKslQOEs), the band [Blood, Sweat, and Tears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5jNJd7HRVU), or [1980s hip hop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyYqkRv0D5g), for example), then little bits of those sounds that show up in something that is new to her can amplify old emotions or memories. For country, that might be a way of playing guitar. Brass instruments like the trumpet and trombone in a rock band might take her back to Blood, Sweat, and Tears. "Old school" beat samples may draw out '80s hip hop. It is nearly impossible to talk about music without these memories and experiences. The hard part, of course, is that we all live different lives. Therefore, when we hear something new (or old), we hear it differently. Even if it's a supposedly "simple" rock beat.

2. If you have no expectations—maybe because something you hear, see, or taste is brand new to you—it's really hard to guess what is coming next. Because it changes over time, music makes this easier. We just have to wait a moment to find out. With visual art that is static (like a painting), we might look more closely. We return to what we saw and think about it differently. Music vanishes into the air as soon as we hear it. We are left with memories of the sound and of how our bodies reacted to it. Maybe we danced and felt the movement. Perhaps we are at a loud live concert where we were pushed around by the sound waves. I still remember the sensation of how the heavy drums at a [Lenny Kravitz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LhCd1W2V0Q) concert physically shoved my guts to the back of my ribcage when I was in high school.

3. If the sound repeats, then it is easier to find a pattern and build an expectation. Of course, it also sets us up as listeners to be surprised when the repetition ends. And some patterns show themselves to us more quickly: that, again, is based on what we have heard before.

In the case of the beat above, the pattern is broadly (but not universally) familiar. It's also repetitive over a short *cycle*. I use the word cycle here to reference a single iteration of the pattern. Cycles can be measured in time (seconds, milliseconds, minutes, hours) or by some internal structure. Usually these are called *beats*, but that word gets used in many other ways, too. We'll come back to it.

### Organizing time

That earlier pattern is fairly simple (which doesn't mean that it's not interesting or full of potential creativity). More intricate patterns with less regular internal relationships can make it harder to grasp what's happening at first. More significantly, however, is the fact that there is no single way to hear or feel rhythm, let alone music. Here is a common rhythmic cycle from African diasporic traditions, especially in Brazil, Cuba, and the United States. It usually gets played on an instrument that is loud and clear. Musicians use this pattern to hold everything else together, so it needs to be audible over the rest of the music.

```
PLAY LOOP
Rumba   .--.--.---.--.--
Don't show the pattern
```

Go back and listen to that again, but try and clap along this time. Just see if you can work it out. It might be hard, it might be easy. Where does the cycle start? Can you hear the point where it repeats?

*Really, listen again and try clapping or tapping along. Then try to tap at the beginning of each cycle. Once you do, click "Done" below to show the next paragraphs.*

```
PLAY LOOP
Rumba   .--.--.---.--.--
Show the pattern this time, mark "clap" and make that sound different
```

Here is an example of this pattern in practice. See if you can hear it: [TODO](TODO). You might have heard the pattern differently, though. If we move the clap to another part of the pattern, it changes the character.

```
PLAY LOOP
Rumba   .--.--.---.--.--

```

[Here is an entire blog post that highlights this version of the pattern](TODO) (TODO cite), calling it the "American clave," a reference to a common name given to this figure. Here are some examples from that article. Note that the clap to start the pattern happens during a silence. Rhythm is not just about sound, it's about the creative use of space, too.

### Ambiguous terms

It's worth discussing the words *rhythm* and *beat* themselves before trying to use them to talk about other things. People use these words interchangeably and, in fact, they can mean the same thing. They also might refer to different, but related, ideas in a way that can be confusing for an essay like this. I am going to separate them out while recognizing that the distinctions are somewhat artificial.

A *rhythm* refers to sounds and silences that are associated based on their relationship in time. They come together to create a unified "thing" that might appear again. Some traditions have well-recognized names for certain rhythms. When rhythms that are familiar appear in different contexts, they might gain referential meanings over time. ["Shave and a haircut, two bits"](TODO)[^shave] was a common ending to songs during a (TODO a certain?) period of American popular music history. It was so common that it could be [stylized](TODO) and [satirized](TODO). The *dembow* rhythm comes from a specific place and history[^dembow]. Like the examples above, it demonstrates how repeating a *rhythm* can turn it into a *groove*, to use a technical term. Push play to hear the rhythm by itself, then click "loop" to hear it repeat. That repeated version underlines global popular music styles ranging from [TODO](TODO) to [TODO](TODO).

```

```

The collection of sounds that gives forward momentum to a piece of music using rhythms and cycles of looping rhythmic phrases is often called *the beat*. As Part 2 describes, the *beat* of a song can also refer to a steady pulse that we sense in our bodies. The confluence of the pulse and the music that marks that pulse creates a terminological ambiguity that can be confusing when writing about sound. Plus, artificially limiting the meanings of these words can be tedious and unhelpful. Doing so, though, can assist us in getting to the specifics of what our bodies sense holistically.

Musicians and people talking about music use these ambiguities in meaningful ways. When "the beat drops" in a song, the entire groove of the music changes in dramatic and powerful ways. That the change happens at a specific moment (*a beat*) and caused by changes to the repetition of rhythms (*the beat*) is not lost on dancers in a club who are anticipating the drop, ready for the boost of energy. Anticipation, which is related to expectation, builds as the musician here (a DJ) toys with the sound of the music. The pacing of the music doesn't change, but something in *the beat* does. It's better to hear this in action. It's best to feel it happen, since rhythm and music are things that our body senses. We'll return to this idea later, too, but for now, here is an example to watch and listen to. Let yourself *feel* these sounds as much as you *hear* them or *see* people reacting: [TODO](TODO).

## Part 2: Cycles, grooves, and time

We can divide time into pieces, both small and large. Seconds or minutes move quickly when compared to hours, days, and weeks. We can count seconds, but we feel hours passing differently. We generally use sleep to mark days and weather or larger cycles tell us about passing months or years. The same is true for music. While writing music down on paper forces us to measure things in certain ways, those methods don't necessarily align with how we feel sound's temporal momentum.

Western classical music, as it is often taught in schools, focuses on grouping smaller divisions of time to create *measures*, also called *bars*. These are called *beats*, adding another use of that term. Most musics around the world, including many European and American styles, use rhythmic cycles to orient the listener. The rock beat from earlier shows this: within much popular music, the cyclic repetitions provide momentum and stability while the subtle variations (like those in the dance club) manipulate that stability to create anticipation. This is one reason why popular music can be criticized as "mechanical"[^Adorno], but it's also one of the reasons why it is accessible and engaging.

These cycles even have names: a high school jazz band percussionist may get sheet music with a small label in the upper left hand corner that says "samba," "funk," "rock," or "bossa nova." These terms refer to adaptable patterns that someone might learn as they improve at the drum set. They play this cyclic pattern ("lay down the beat," perhaps) and provide a foundation for the rest of the ensemble. The player is not a machine, though. She will incorporate nuances and changes to match other things that are happening in other parts of the ensemble or to toy with the energy level of the performance. The pattern ("funk" or "bossa") is a skeletal guide.[^notation]

In many Middle Eastern musical styles, these patterns have similar names, each with its own history, appropriate place, and connotation. Johnny Farraj and Sami Abu Shumays describe many of them in *Inside Arab Music*, but they also outline a selection on their website: [maqamworld.com](http://www.maqamworld.com/en/iqaa.php). These patterns, collectively called *iqa'at*, are made of up two general types of drum strokes (or other sounds): *dum* signifies a lower, heavier sound while *tek* is usually higher or lighter. Maqamworld.com uses the letters D and T to show these, with S signifying a pause or silence. Take a moment to listen to the ways in which some of these cycles work in different pieces: [the iqa' called *maqsum*](http://www.maqamworld.com/en/iqaa/maqsum.php) is a popular one to start with. [The examples for *ayyoub*](http://www.maqamworld.com/en/iqaa/ayyub.php) show a huge diversity of stylistic range within one pattern. Some, like [*zaffa*](http://www.maqamworld.com/en/iqaa/zaffa.php) are specifically linked to certain traditions, in this case a wedding procession, even though they now appear in other styles and contexts. Listening to a symphony orchestra presenting popular music, as when [a group like Black Violin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb5zO7OybPg) incorporates hip hop beats into classical chamber music contexts, gives an idea of how a rhythmic pattern (a funky hip hop beat) can hold its identity in a seemingly unrelated context (on the violin and in classical music halls).

### Layers of interaction

Cyclic rhythmic patterns can grow and adapt in many ways. One is through improvisation: a musician can subtly change the placement of certain sounds, add new ones, or remove a few parts of the rhythm to regulate energy. "Regulate" sounds so sterile, it's about getting a crowd hype or making them hold their collective breath in anticipation. Groups of people can work together to do the same. If you have ever clapped along to a piece or changed how you move your feet while dancing, you were co-creating a pattern. This happens when, at a concert, everyone starts jumping together or swaying from side to side, cell phone flashlights held high. Rhythm can draw people in and together.

Another form of adaptation is layering. A technical term for a repeating rhythmic pattern is an *ostinato*. When one of these ostinatos (rhythmic cycles) appears alongside another, they can combine to create something identifiably new. This is how a drum set works. A pattern on a bass drum appears alongside a second one on a snare drum, perhaps a third on a high hat cymbal, and others on floor toms, larger cymbals, or other instruments to create an intricate groove.

A simple example from my own research in Morocco demonstrates this well (Witulski 2019). This is a pattern that appears in much popular music, but I crossed paths with it when researching a sacred ritual tradition as practiced by the *ʿissawa* brotherhood.[^issawa] It is part of a Muslim trance ceremony that involves prayer, devotional singing, and plenty of dancing and fun. This rhythm animates the moments where the musical ensemble invites laughter and popular religious songs into a long night of prayer and healing. The rhythmic pattern that I want to focus on also appears in a tradition of sung poetry called *malhun* that includes both "sacred" texts and "secular" ones.

![ʿIssawa ensemble performing in Fez, note the *tabla* drums](TODO)

In *ʿissawa* contexts, this pattern shows up on a pair of clay drums that are tied together. Some artists have switched from these traditional drums, however, to use manufactured *timbales*. In both cases, a larger and smaller drum makes two distinct sounds: one is lower and the other is higher. In *malhun*, different musicians each have small handheld goblet-shaped drums. Each one, called a *tarʿija* has a slightly different sound because of the natural fish-skin head.

![Malhun ensemble performing in Fez](TODO)

These pairs of drums articulate two patterns. The first is two notes, equally spaced. This usually shows up on the larger drum. The second is offset and the notes are unequally spaced. In live settings, people might clap along to one or the other patterns. Try listening to each and clapping along with it individually.

```
BUTTONS: Play, Loop? Then show pattern with moving line?
P1 BUTTON WITH VISUAL: D - - - D - - -
P2 BUTTON WITH VISUAL: - - - T - - T -
```

Combining the two patterns changes the feel. They integrate into a single idea, yet people still clap along to the individual parts. Try identifying and clapping the distinct patterns when listening to the two of them together. Then, mute one and attempt to carry on the other.

```
BUTTONS: Loop, show both patterns, mute or quiet buttons for each
```

These are pretty mechanical examples. Real people making music will make other changes as well. The music speeds up as it gets closer to the climactic ending of a section or poem. As it speeds up, musicians will slightly adjust the relationships between the two patterns. They might make the last note of the second (offset) pattern louder to push listeners back to the beginning of the cycle in a way that you can feel when you move. They might squeeze the two middle notes, which are already close together, even tighter to make the music feel rushed or excited. These details are the subject of Part 3.

## Part 3: Feeling the beat(s)

Just as musical repetition and relationships can orient listeners over long stretches of time, smaller details impact how we feel music. Some of these details go unnoticed in common discussions of sound. For example, they may not appear in written music notation in western contexts. That does not mean that they don't exist or that we don't feel them.

Much of the world's music has a sense of *pulse*, a consistent sense of motion. This is one of many terms that is difficult to describe in words without falling back on other equally problematic sets of terminology. It also resists being bounded into a specific definition. Take dance: a pulse can be the points in time where you put your feet down or, in the case of Argentinean tango music, where you step while walking. Listen here and watch as the dancers' feet move in a somewhat consistent pulse, or, to use another term, to the beat.

```
Tango example with obvious pulse and walking motion
```

That word, *beat*, returns here. The *pulse* is often referred to as the *beat*, but I will nudge the meaning here to say that each pulse—each moment in time—is a *beat*. These beats that make up the pulse are not identical to the rhythm, though in Western music notation systems, they do get used to calculate larger structures like *meter*.

One striking aspect of *pulse* and *beats* in a piece of music is that listeners can sense them, even if no sound happens at those moments in time. They are not explicitly aligned with strikes on a drum or chords on a guitar. They exist among and between sounds. They are perceived.

Listen to this rhythm. The consistent pulse is explicitly presented between the two instruments (a bass drum and snare drum). Try clapping a *pulse* and then unmute it to hear whether you agree with what I give.

```
PLAY                D D T - D - T -
MUTED, then play    C - C - C - C -
```

In this case, every beat of the pulse (at least as I hear it) is played by one of the instruments. Here's another example that's similar. Try clapping along again.

```
PLAY  D D Td- - - T -
MUTED C - C - C - C -
mark red      ^
```

This time, the beat in the middle of the repeating pattern (marked in red) is not articulated, but you may have still felt it. Your body moves the same way and the clap feels appropriate there. This is the result of *syncopation*, an emphasized sound that does not appear at an obvious moment. In this case, the bass drum hit shows up before the expected beat.

As stated above, this is not just about drums. Here is a line that could be in a funk band horn section. Even without the rest of a group, you may be able to hear or feel the beat. In each example, try listening with the clapping sound marking out the beat and without to feel the difference.

```
HORN EXAMPLES
 - Select different loops
 - Option to play or mute clapping
Largely on the beat
Lots of space
Lots of off-beats
```

Not all music has an underlying beat. When a musician performs "freely" and without adherence to a consistent pulse, it can be termed *free rhythm*. This happens in solo introductions to a piece of music that showcases a performer's virtuosic and expressive technique or may be a smaller section of a larger work. Without an underlying consistent beat, a musical idea can still toy with related ideas like *pacing* to generate motion and tension. By moving from slow to fast or suddenly shifting the momentum, free rhythm can generate a powerful feeling of rhythmic direction.

### Grouping beats

Even when the pulse is fairly consistent—and there are plenty of ways to manipulate it so that it's not—we don't hear music as a steady stream of even sounds. It's certainly possible to intentionally give that sensation to listeners, but usually we hear and feel weight in different places. These groupings comprise the concept of *meter*, though that term can be tied into music notation in ways that are not always helpful. Like so much else here, these are easier to hear or feel than they are to describe.

Most groupings are either *duple*, sets that are multiples of two, or *triple*, sets of three. They can be combined to make innumerable other possibilities. They can also both happen at once. Most popular music is duple: rhythmic patterns like the ones described above overlay a pulse of evenly grouped beats. You might clap or step at different points. I might hear something as a group of 4 quick beats where you hear 2 slow ones. Unless you are trying to write music down, that distinction is unimportant. Here is the earlier loop with claps happening at a different rate. They divide the pulse differently, but they are both duple. 

```
D D T - D - T -
C - C - C - C -
C - - - C - - -
```

Each group is called a *measure* or *bar* and where those measures start and end can be arbitrary. In the above example, someone could feal each iteration as one bar or 

Triple groupings *feel* different. Here is an example from the American old time fiddling tradition that I'll play on the banjo while counting beats. The lilting sensation is at the core of many dances that accompany this grouping. Or, perhaps better put, to the music that accompanies the dances.

```
OLD TIME WALTZ
```

If the pace quickens, though, we might feel the central pulse at a different place. I'll repeat it faster and try to keep up with the counting before adjusting from a triple beat to a duple one that is split into thirds.

```
OLD TIME WALTZ FAST, SHIFT FROM 1 2 3 to 1 - - 2 - -
```

We can also add sets of duple or triple groupings to make more complicated ones. Arabic music has a classical form called *samaʿi* that is technically ten beats. In practice, however, it is a group of three, a group of four (or two pairs), and another group of three.

```
samaʿi with counting, maybe a 4 screen video with counting, riqq, violin, oud?
Or an audio with a diagram
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
[   ] [     ] [   ]
```

These groupings can appear in ways that foster ambiguity for the listener to generate tension or space. Rhythms can spread over time in a way that emphasizes two or more different pulses simultaneously. This displacement can be troubling or exciting. Stephen Friedson argues that it opens the body to an experience of trance (TODO). Ann Danielsen describes how the guitar groove in James Brown's famous song "Sex Machine" creates its own pulse that is slightly offset from the main one in the drums (TODO). In this case, it does not bring about trance. It gives life to funk. In either case, a similar musical practice impacts the listener in a contextually-defined way, but both change our perception (TODO Becker).

Listen to this example of (TODO) and clap along to the pulse that you hear. Then unmute the first given pulse to see if it aligns with what you felt. Mute it again and try the second one. Then, if you are up to the challenge, try shifting your perception from one to the other and back, either with the pulse audio samples muted or unmuted. At first, it might feel unnatural. Eventually, and with familiarity, it may get easier.

```
AUDIO LOOP
PULSE 1 (MUTED)
PULSE 2 (MUTED)
```

### Dividing time

Just as beats are organized into larger groups, they are divided and hold smaller collections that we can feel. Of all of the rhythmic concepts discussed here, this might be the one where notational practices in western tradition differs the most from the sounds that we hear. Notes that land between beats do so at specific moments. They allude to regularity, but rarely come at mathematically consistent intervals. Instead, a musician's expressivity will push a note just before or after, making it subtly early or late.

The consistent division of beats that creates an expectation for listeners is called the *subdivision*. The nudges that happen in practice usually go unspoken, but some analysts and music theorists call it *microtiming*. Subdivisions are easy to talk about and hear in practice. Microtiming involves a level of nuance that can be harder.

In western music theory practice, subdivision is generally taught as duple or triple, just like meter (the larger grouping of beats). A duple subdivision divides each beat into halves or a multiple of two. A triple subdivision divides them into three. These terms are related to each other and are all ways to describe how music organizes time at different scopes. Remembering that the pulse, measures, and subdivisions are perceived by listeners and not necessarily made explicit in the music helps to keep the priority on what we actually do hear: the sounds that move us. The following examples present these concepts as a total system. The music always plays, but you can mute or unmute the different scopes (measures, beats, and subdivisions) to hear what each describes.

```

[^notation]: This way of thinking about how to organize time in music differs from how rhythm and a concept called *meter* are taught in many music classrooms. Where this approach follows the way people make, listen to, and feel music in many contexts across the world (including Europe in Europe and the United States and in classical music traditions), the teaching of rhythm and meter often focuses on quasi-mathematical procedures that relate to written musical notation. Notation is important for a number of reasons, but there is much that it does not represent well, including nuances in rhythm that change the "feel" of a pattern (TODO: cite issues). As seen in the maqamworld.com examples above, musicians globally can use western notational techniques as a tool to represent sound, but they recognize its failures and it rarely shows up in performance. This, again, is true in "the west": innumerable outstanding musicians never needed to learn to read music to wield it powerfully. Notation is an abstraction that can serve a purpose (namely, it can preserve and transmit some elements of sound for distribution, analysis, or similar goals). Also relevant is the fact that there are many other representational systems available to musicians and listeners, not only the one that has roots in European classical traditions (TODO: citations of other systems).

[^issawa]: In this case, the term "brotherhood" refers to the all male musical ensembles who carry out ritual ceremonies. The events themselves are usually open to client families (who require healing through sacred blessing) and their friends. There are other rituals within the tradition that happen in religious spaces and are differentiated by gender.

## Part 4: Dividing time

Just as beats are organized into larger groups, they are divided and hold smaller collections that we can feel. Of all of the rhythmic concepts discussed here, this might be the one where notational practices in western tradition differs the most from the sounds that we hear. Notes that land between beats do so at specific moments. They allude to regularity, but rarely come at mathematically consistent intervals. Instead, a musician's expressivity will push a note just before or after, making it subtly early or late.

The consistent division of beats that creates an expectation for listeners is called the *subdivision*. The nudges that happen in practice usually go unspoken, but some analysts and music theorists call it *microtiming*. Subdivisions are easy to talk about and hear in practice. Microtiming involves a level of nuance that can be harder.

In western music theory practice, subdivision is generally taught as duple or triple, just like meter (the larger grouping of beats). A duple subdivision divides each beat into halves or a multiple of two. A triple subdivision divides them into three. These terms are related to each other and are all ways to describe how music organizes time at different scopes. Remembering that the pulse, measures, and subdivisions are perceived by listeners and not necessarily made explicit in the music helps to keep the priority on what we actually do hear: the sounds that move us. The following examples present these concepts as a total system. The music always plays, but you can mute or unmute the different scopes (measures, beats, and subdivisions) to hear what each describes.

```

### Playing with subdivisions

This conceptual structure of divisions serves as a groundwork for what a musician or ensemble actually does in practice. A common version of this is a technique of changing subdivisions that is called *swing*. This was common in early jazz and became the name of an entire genre, but it shows up elsewhere, too. In swing, a duple subdivision turns into something else: the musicians lengthen the first half of the subdivision and shorten the second half. This means that they are no longer halves. A frequent division is for the first "half" to be two-thirds of the beat, leaving one-third for the second "half." This particular division turns into a mathematical *triple* subdivision where the first two thirds are linked together and roughly aligns with another name: a *shuffle*.

```
BEAT .     .     .     .     .     .
DUP  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
TRI  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
SWI  .   . .   . .   . .   . .   . .
```

While the norm is to work within it to build off of a listener's expectations, memorable moments or funky grooves (to use a technical term) can work against it. Musicians do not typically adhere to mathematical certainties. They can and do, but they make use of the flexibility that live performance offers.[^computers] TODO describes how jazz musicians vary the degree of their swing to create an individual style while also changing the ratios of their subdivisions at different points of a performance to build and release tension (TODO cite). TODO shares similar ideas about Brazilian samba music, showing that this is not unique to the genre known as "swing" (TODO cite). These methods of manipulating time in practice (not conceptually as above) are examples of *microtiming*, adjusting the timing of notes in slight, but noticeable, ways.

[^computers]: It should be said that flexibility in subdivisions and other expressive techniques are not exclusive to human performers. Electronic music has this capability and, in some cases, can do so with more specific intentionality on the part of the composer or producer than a live performer.

To hear some examples, move the slider below to change the subdivision ratio and listen to how the "feel" of the simple swing drum set beat changes.

So far, the discussion of subdivision has been about grooves, repeating patterns that orient the music. This technique of rushing or delaying notes can happen anywhere in a piece of music, but it is a matter of balance. Breaking too far from expectations or norms could confuse a listener or dancer, but sticking to them methodically might get dull.

One of my own favorite moments demonstrating this happens in a performance of "Watermelon Man" by Mongo Santamaria (TODO introduce). While listening, try to let yourself feel the groove and, if the music inspires you, move along with it or clap. Then, *feel* what happens in the horn section (brass instruments) at (TODO time). When I listen, it feels as if the band is figuratively dragging the horn players along with them and, when everyone aligns again, it is a huge relief that I feel more than I hear.

## Part 3: Feeling the beat(s)

Just as musical repetition and relationships can orient listeners over long stretches of time, smaller details impact how we feel music. Some of these details go unnoticed in common discussions of sound. For example, they may not appear in written music notation in western contexts. That does not mean that they don't exist or that we don't feel them.

Much of the world's music has a sense of *pulse*, a consistent sense of motion. This is one of many terms that is difficult to describe in words without falling back on other equally problematic sets of terminology. It also resists being bounded into a specific definition. Take dance: a pulse can be the points in time where you put your feet down or, in the case of Argentinean tango music, where you step while walking. Listen here and watch as the dancers' feet move in a somewhat consistent pulse, or, to use another term, to the beat.

```

That word, *beat*, returns here. The *pulse* is often referred to as the *beat*, but I will nudge the meaning here to say that each pulse—each moment in time—is a *beat*. These beats that make up the pulse are not identical to the rhythm, though in Western music notation systems, they do get used to calculate larger structures like *meter*.

One striking aspect of *pulse* and *beats* in a piece of music is that listeners can sense them, even if no sound happens at those moments in time. They are not explicitly aligned with strikes on a drum or chords on a guitar. They exist among and between sounds. They are perceived.

Listen to this rhythm. The consistent pulse is explicitly presented between the two instruments (a bass drum and snare drum). Try clapping a *pulse* and then unmute it to hear whether you agree with what I give.

```
PLAY                D D T - D - T -
MUTED, then play    C - C - C - C -
```

In this case, every beat of the pulse (at least as I hear it) is played by one of the instruments. Here's another example that's similar. Try clapping along again.

```
PLAY  D D Td- - - T -
MUTED C - C - C - C -
mark red      ^
```

This time, the beat in the middle of the repeating pattern (marked in red) is not articulated, but you may have still felt it. Your body moves the same way and the clap feels appropriate there. This is the result of *syncopation*, an emphasized sound that does not appear at an obvious moment. In this case, the bass drum hit shows up before the expected beat.

As stated above, this is not just about drums. Here is a line that could be in a funk band horn section. Even without the rest of a group, you may be able to hear or feel the beat. In each example, try listening with the clapping sound marking out the beat and without to feel the difference.

```
HORN EXAMPLES
 - Select different loops
 - Option to play or mute clapping
Largely on the beat
Lots of space
Lots of off-beats
```

Not all music has an underlying beat. When a musician performs "freely" and without adherence to a consistent pulse, it can be termed *free rhythm*. This happens in solo introductions to a piece of music that showcases a performer's virtuosic and expressive technique or may be a smaller section of a larger work. Without an underlying consistent beat, a musical idea can still toy with related ideas like *pacing* to generate motion and tension. By moving from slow to fast or suddenly shifting the momentum, free rhythm can generate a powerful feeling of rhythmic direction.

### Grouping beats

Even when the pulse is fairly consistent—and there are plenty of ways to manipulate it so that it's not—we don't hear music as a steady stream of even sounds. It's certainly possible to intentionally give that sensation to listeners, but usually we hear and feel weight in different places. These groupings comprise the concept of *meter*, though that term can be tied into music notation in ways that are not always helpful. Like so much else here, these are easier to hear or feel than they are to describe.

Most groupings are either *duple*, sets that are multiples of two, or *triple*, sets of three. They can be combined to make innumerable other possibilities. They can also both happen at once. Most popular music is duple: rhythmic patterns like the ones described above overlay a pulse of evenly grouped beats. You might clap or step at different points. I might hear something as a group of 4 quick beats where you hear 2 slow ones. Unless you are trying to write music down, that distinction is unimportant. Here is the earlier loop with claps happening at a different rate. They divide the pulse differently, but they are both duple. 

```
D D T - D - T -
C - C - C - C -
C - - - C - - -
```

Each group is called a *measure* or *bar* and where those measures start and end can be arbitrary. In the above example, someone could feal each iteration as one bar or 

Triple groupings *feel* different. Here is an example from the American old time fiddling tradition that I'll play on the banjo while counting beats. The lilting sensation is at the core of many dances that accompany this grouping. Or, perhaps better put, to the music that accompanies the dances.

```
OLD TIME WALTZ
```

If the pace quickens, though, we might feel the central pulse at a different place. I'll repeat it faster and try to keep up with the counting before adjusting from a triple beat to a duple one that is split into thirds.

```
OLD TIME WALTZ FAST, SHIFT FROM 1 2 3 to 1 - - 2 - -
```

We can also add sets of duple or triple groupings to make more complicated ones. Arabic music has a classical form called *samaʿi* that is technically ten beats. In practice, however, it is a group of three, a group of four (or two pairs), and another group of three.

```
samaʿi with counting, maybe a 4 screen video with counting, riqq, violin, oud?
Or an audio with a diagram
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
[   ] [     ] [   ]
```

These groupings can appear in ways that foster ambiguity for the listener to generate tension or space. Rhythms can spread over time in a way that emphasizes two or more different pulses simultaneously. This displacement can be troubling or exciting. Stephen Friedson argues that it opens the body to an experience of trance (TODO). Ann Danielsen describes how the guitar groove in James Brown's famous song "Sex Machine" creates its own pulse that is slightly offset from the main one in the drums (TODO). In this case, it does not bring about trance. It gives life to funk. In either case, a similar musical practice impacts the listener in a contextually-defined way, but both change our perception (TODO Becker).

Listen to this example of (TODO) and clap along to the pulse that you hear. Then unmute the first given pulse to see if it aligns with what you felt. Mute it again and try the second one. Then, if you are up to the challenge, try shifting your perception from one to the other and back, either with the pulse audio samples muted or unmuted. At first, it might feel unnatural. Eventually, and with familiarity, it may get easier.

```
AUDIO LOOP
PULSE 1 (MUTED)
PULSE 2 (MUTED)
```

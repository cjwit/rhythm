## Part 5: Consistent inconsistencies from Morocco

One of my main goals in this series is to disassociate widely used terminology from an exclusive understanding based in western classical music and a specific system of written notation. Rhythm is central to music worldwide, even in contexts where it is important in absentia, in common practices like free rhythm improvisations. It is difficult to imagine music that does not incorporate a sense of passing time and, where that might seem possible, it commonly works in contrast to something else that happens before or afterward.

The exclusive association of ideas like beat and meter to western systems has a secondary impact: it leads analysts to consider all music from a set of expectations that adhere to western classical music or other western traditions. Using three examples from my own research in Morocco, I aim to demonstrate how centering experience and perception and decentering prescriptive conceptions of musical elements brings about new ideas of how music works.[^ethnography]

### Uneven beats

Two of these three examples come from the *hamadsha* tradition. The hamadsha brotherhood is a Muslim Sufi group, which means that they regularly gather to perform and participate in sung devotional poetry. Unlike some other Sufi brotherhoods, the hamadsha are organized as professional ensembles who visit client houses to chant and sing poetry along with instrumental accompaniment. They are closely linked to the figure of Aisha, a spirit who possesses some individuals. One of the goals of their ritual healing ceremonies is the maintenance of the relationship between Aisha and her host body. They help the client to appease Aisha through chanting, prayer, singing, a trance possession "dance," and the ritual sacrifice of animals like chickens and goats.[^hamadsha]

The hamadsha ceremony moves through a number of segments, each with its own musical characteristics. One, called the *saf al-ginbri* features an underlying rhythmic pattern of uneven heavy beats with a consistent subdivision. This pattern is also common elsewhere in the world, including the Balkan region of Europe and across the Middle East.[^5-8] This example is from a ceremony I attended with the hamadsha leader Abdderrahim Amrani.

```
PLAY EXAMPLE
BEAT  .   .
SUB   . . . . .
```

A western system would define this as a 5/8 meter by focusing on the greatest even "beat." In practice, however, this is felt at the larger grouping of one short beat (with two subdivisions) and one that is slightly longer (with three subdivisions). It is possible to write this as 2 + 3, but that also prioritizes writing over hearing and feeling.

### Shrinking beats

A second pattern is both more complicated from the perspective of western musical systems and far simpler when understood on its own terms. This comes from another Moroccan ritual healing ceremony, this time as part of the gnawa tradition. This music is widely associated with Morocco's history of slavery and the sub-Saharan Africans who were brought to the country from West African countries like Mali in the past through the trans-Saharan slave trade. This ritual also serves to heal clients by repairing the relationship between them and possessing spirits, but here Aisha is just one of many. As with the hamadsha, the ceremony moves through various segments. These are associated with specific colors (black, white, blue, and so on) that identify individual spirits or sets of spirits who might possess the client. The music of each segment is specific to that spirit, but it is more broadly similar throughout than the music that animates the hamadsha ceremony.

Gnawa music uses three types of instruments. A single low bass string instrument called a *hajhuj* or *ginbri* is at its core. This is the only melodic instrument. A large drum called a *tbal* appears in certain places. Of interest here, though are the *quraqib*, sets of iron castanets that beat out consistent rhythmic patterns throughout most of the overnight ceremony.

![Quraqib, as demonstrated by TODO](TODO)

Most individual songs in gnawa music start slowly and get faster as the trance intensifies.[^tempo] Increasing the speed is not uncommon globally, but it works differently in many western traditions. For example, it may happen at the end of a piece to build excitement in a similar way, but rarely occurs gradually throughout the entire thing. And when it does happen in western traditions, the internal subdivision pacing increases with the speed of the beats. This maintains the relationships between them (at least roughly). A duple subdivision usually stays duple. But not always: at higher speeds, it can get harder to maintain those relationships simply because shorter notes get too short to play.

This is what happens in gnawa music. The pattern that starts a piece gets so fast that the musicians "even out" the distance between the subdivisions. The mathmatical ratios are less important than the intensity of the experience. They do not lock into one set of relationshipos and then "lock" into a new one. Instead, the change happens gradually. In this example, it moves from a feeling of a duple subdivision to a triple one as the long note shortens. These three moments are from different parts of "TODO CHOOSE TUNE" as played by Abderrahim Abderrazak, my teacher during my fieldwork in Fez, Morocco.

```

The beginning and ending rhythms can be easily represented using western musical notation, but the gradual change throughout the song means that most of the relationships that bring a person into trance cannot. The subdivision relationships here are not a result of a larger conceptual framework. They come from a group of people who are playing as fast as they can so that their music can be intense enough to invite a spirit into the room and heal a listener. In this way, what we hear reflects a specific set of priorities.

### Poetic license

The final rhythm animates two different segments of the *hamadsha* brotherhood's ritual. *Al-unasa al-saghira* comes first and features this pattern articulated with clapping. *Al-unsasa al-kabira* returns later in the evening and uses drums. Both segments focus on sung devotional poetry that aligns with a rhythmic pattern of five beats (or five claps) that can be loosely described as short, long, short, short, long.

```
SHORT LONG SHORT SHORT LONG
BOXES OR MARKS TO SHOW DURATION
```

This pattern is not always articulated, aligning it more closely to the concept of beat or pulse than a rhythm. To the contrary, different rhythms appear in more complex clapping and drumming patterns that layer over this organizing set. Take, for example, a common and structural rhythm that Abderrahim Amrani and Fredrick Calmus, members of the brotherhood I worked with most closely, taught me.

```
BEAT  |   |     |   |   |     end
DRUM  t d t  d  t   t d d     end
```

There are two characteristics of this poetic accompaniment that are noteworthy here. First, the beat or pulse is consistent over the course of the pattern, but not every beat is the same duration. Second, the subdivision stays duple (beats are divided in two) whether the beat is short or long.

To the first point, one of the core assumptions about rhythm in western-centric systems of understanding is that the pulse is made up of evenly-spaced beats.[^exceptions] In fact, this pattern can be mathematically broken down and written in western notation. The "long" beats are equal to three halves of the short beats.

[^exceptions]: There are some common exceptions, including when the tempo changes. The tempo is the rate of passing beats or the speed of the underlying pulse. When it increases, beats will "speed up" and the distance between them gets shorter.

```
BEAT b | b |  | b | b | b |  |
```

Imagining this pattern as comprised of twelve equal-but-even-shorter beats makes it easy to create groupings of two and three. This aligns with the first hamadsha rhythm that I introduced earlier. It fits into western notation, but I argue that it fails to account for the clearly-defined nature of how these rhythms are articulated. That brings us to the second point.

When a musician places an emphasis at a moment that sits between beats or between subdivisions, it is called *syncopation*. This can make for a surprising and energetic moment, and it is a common and useful tool. This pattern divides the long beat (the second beat) in half. If we understand the subdivision to be consistent and even, as in the last depiction, then the drum stroke or clap that divides the second beat is syncopated.

This pattern repeats over and over throughout the long poetic recitation, however. While it may feel syncopated at first, the listener grows accustomed to the pattern. If we allow for a pulse of uneven beats (some long and some short) with subdivisions that divide them in half instead of mathematically attempting to fit this into a structural conceptualization designed for a different set of musical traditions, then we can more closely approximate what is happening. This visualization allows you to listen to the pattern while switching between depictions of the subdivisions/beats. The syncopated version may feel more appropriate to you. Maybe not. The point is not that one is correct: we all hear and feel music differently. Instead, the point is that we can allow for western-centric "rules" to be "broken."

```
BEAT  |   |     |   |   |     end
DRUM  t d t  d  t   t d d     end
HIGHLIGHT SYNCOPATION
TOGGLE VISUAL OF SUBDIVISIONS
```

Up until now, I have been using electronically created beats to demonstrate this pattern. In practice, however, there is an additional nuance. The last beat of the cycle is late. This is an example of the microtiming and syncopation techniques I mention above, but it is not relevant to a specific moment in time. The subtle play with time that can build and release tension happens every time. It becomes a core part of the pattern, though the amount of delay may change to create more excitement.

## Conclusions

START HERE

[^ethnography]: While my research was ethnographic fieldwork over roughly three years in Morocco, these observations are my own. I hope to take the ideas I present here back to Morocco and make them central to interviews and conversations to see whether people share them. This is difficult in part, however, because the terminologies used by musicians trained in western systems (wherever they might live and work) do not always align with how listeners talk about music.

# Comments for revision

## Minor changes/footnotes

- [x] A) In the sixth to last sentence, there is one small spelling error, “inappropriately” may replace “in appropriately.”

- [x] B) There was a suggestion from one reviewer to offer a brief overview of “notions of meter, beat, and pulse as understood through a notational lens (e.g. How do notes in a given measure reflect the prescribed time signature?).” [We think this is currently well-addressed in your second footnote.]

> I assume that you mean the second footnote of the second page (the longer one). If you are comfortable with this, I will leave it as is. My hope is to avoid hindering accessibility by interrupting a flow with these discussions, hence the use of footnotes. I will point some of these ideas out in the introduction so that these goals are more obvious at the outset.

- [x] C) One reviewer suggested connecting with music education curricula by at least briefly referencing bols/takadimi systems in South Asian music and how time (beats, subdivisions, rhythms, etc.) are verbalized.

> Added a short description and reference to the footnote on education.

- [ ] F) A reviewer suggests adding a reference to the Music of the Spheres and its relationship to planetary rhythms and cycles in the first section. A brief little addition to the first paragraph could give some historical context.

> I'm split on this. I could add it (the idea of linking sound to an understanding of the universe does work well in an introduction!), but I'm concerned about foregrounding the kind of Greek histories that highlight western traditions and understandings in a piece that is actively trying to avoid that. Further, my understanding of the music of the spheres is that it is more about the ratios that create the harmonic series (and philosophy, of course). I looked at the Oxford Music Online entry and don't see much about rhythm, per se. The most compelling part is about expectation (Plato's idea that these resonances are audible to everyone since birth, but unnoticed). As an aside, this sounds a lot like a religion in a young adult series that I just finished reading called *Scythe*...

- [x] H) Regarding section 4, a reviewer suggests adding an example of alternative form of notation. They further suggest the possibility of an exercise for students “could be to establish notational methods that differ from those available through Western standard notation.”

> Added a footnote that highlights how the examples are, themselves, alternative forms of notation and that discusses the utility of these systems (with the suggestion to create your own)

## Edit introduction/structure

- [ ] D) Another reviewer suggested that the piece would benefit from an introductory section before section one that gives a clearer indication of the writer’s aim. They further offer “either at the beginning, or further down in one of the sections, the author could also explain how Western notation and musicologies have approached non-western musics for the last century (and more) and how this has had an impact of reception and transmission.” I do think a little bit more introduction would be beneficial to situate yourself and your approach that does draw from a broad range of cultures. Giving a quick birds-eye view would help the reader understand how it is structured. I also think you might introduce the point you make at the beginning of Part 4 (“One of my main goals in this series . . .”) somehow in the introduction. Is there a way you can weave that theme in earlier? Perhaps some of the Conclusion section in Part 4 could be moved to the introduction to give a very clear overview?

- [ ] E) A reviewer notes that the emphasis on Morocco is not explained, so I would suggest adding some context as to why Morocco is central, perhaps in the introduction. (“The author presents the different sections in an interesting manner, it is unclear though why there is such a focus on Morocco, is it because of the author’s own region of specialty or is there something more specific to Moroccan music itself that lends itself to an in- depth study of its rhythmic structures and patterns? If so, it would benefit the piece as a whole to state that and explain it.”). I think this would fit neatly with the additions and changes in section C.

- [x] I) A reviewer suggested adding a chart to demonstrate similarities and differences in the examples suggested (syncopation, cycles, polyrhythms), but we feel that this could easily be treacherous and is likely best avoided.

> I agree: one of the goals here is to avoid that kind of similarity/difference binary to recognize that these broad concepts can be applied in many places. Some specific examples showing types of syncopation, for example, may help, but that would add a lot of length. It's a trade off that I would consider if you both think it's worth it!

- [ ] Jessie A) Whereas I agree that you might consider clarifications and additions in your piece that better outline how Western notation systems, for example, have had an impact on transmission (see point D above), I feel that your attempts to avoid a binary discussion of "Western vs. non-Western" concepts is preferable (see also both my and Kristina's concerns about the suggestion of adding a table of comparing and contrasting. If you feel there is a way to create some type of graph to help explain or summarize concepts of beats, meters/cycles, syncopation, and polyrhythms, then that might be worth adding, but not as a binary chart as one reviewer suggested.

## Beat discussion

- [ ] G) There is also a suggestion about how to perhaps amend the section on dividing time: “Part three clearly shows the reader about pulse, beat and meter. However the concept of dividing time appears to be counter intuitive in many of these musics that don’t employ additive rhythm but have cycles of rhythmic groupings in rhythmic modes. Might this difference between the rhythms of western and non-western music be described in this section? The examples of Irish Jig and West African Bell are very clear, the beat of the couple dancing Tango seems would be more difficult to follow for the non-specialist as well as the midi beats on examples 15 and 16.”

## Clearer examples

- [ ] Kristina A) Thinking about teaching in my own classroom, it would be quite a lot of new terms to give a student in one. I do wonder if there are some places certain things could be streamlined a bit. One example that comes to mind is the final bit of Part 3 where it ends with “Watermelon Man,” introducing what is a cha cha cha after swing. I could see this causing some confusion currently, and I wonder if it might be clearer to stick to an example that is swing after having just introduced it.

- [ ] Jessie B) I also felt that the tango example would be difficult for many students to follow and understand the beats and stylistic deviations. I was thinking perhaps you could leave the example you do have and add an additional "square" clip (if one is readily available) that would line up with the beat and help students focus on one thing (the beat) before hearing how it is played with in practice for stylistic effects (what you include).

## Transcription

- [ ] Kristina B) I also notice a gap in the start of Part 4 in that there hasn’t been any mention of transcription, which is what you are critiquing. Is there a place where there might be space to introduce transcription to provide context to students prior to the discussion in Part 4?

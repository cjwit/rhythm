## Part 3: Feeling the beat(s)

Just as musical repetition and relationships can orient listeners over long stretches of time, smaller details impact how we feel music in the moment. Some of these details go unnoticed in common discussions of sound. For example, they may not appear in written music notation in western contexts. That doesn't mean that they are not important or that we don't feel them.

Much of the world's music has a sense of *pulse*, a consistent sense of motion. This is one of many terms that is difficult to describe in words without falling back on other equally problematic sets of terminology. It also resists being bounded into a specific definition. Take dance: a pulse can be the points in time where you put your feet down or, in the case of Argentinean tango music, where you step while walking. [Listen here and watch](https://www.youtube.com/embed/wIvfPI_GT3U) as the dancers' feet move in a somewhat consistent pulse, or, to use another term, to the beat.

That word, *beat*, returns here. The *pulse* is often referred to as the *beat*, but I will nudge the meaning here to say that each pulse—each moment in time—is a *beat*. These beats that make up the pulse are not identical to the rhythm, though in Western music notation systems, they do get used to calculate larger structures like *meter*.

One striking aspect of the *pulse* and *beats* in a piece of music is that listeners can sense them, even if no sound happens at those moments in time. They are not explicitly aligned with strikes on a drum or chords on a guitar. They exist among and between sounds. They are perceived, imagined, and based on our expectations.

Listen to this rhythm. The consistent pulse is explicitly presented between the two instruments (a bass drum and snare drum). Try clapping a consistent *pulse* along with it and then unmute the "pulse" to hear whether you agree with it.

```
PLAY                D - T D D - T -
MUTED, then play    C - C - C - C - <-PULSE
```

In this case, every beat of the pulse (at least as I hear it) is played by one of the instruments. Here's another example that's similar. Try clapping along again before unmuting.

```
PLAY  D D TD- - - T -
MUTED C - C - C - C -
mark red      ^
```

This time, the beat in the middle of the repeating pattern (marked in red) is not articulated, but you may have still felt it and clapped during the space. Your body moves the same way and the clap feels appropriate there. This is the result of *syncopation*, an emphasized sound that does not appear at an obvious moment. In this case, the bass drum hit shows up before the expected beat.

As stated above, this is not just about drums. Here is a line that could be in a funk band horn section. Even without the rest of a group, you may be able to hear or feel the beat. In each example, try listening with and without the clapping that marks the pulse.

```
HORN EXAMPLES
 - Select different loops
 - Option to play or mute clapping
Largely on the beat
Lots of space
Lots of off-beats
```

Not all music has an underlying pulse. When a musician performs "freely" and without adherence to a consistent pulse, it can be termed *free rhythm*. This happens in solo introductions to a piece of music that showcases a performer's virtuosic and expressive technique. Without an underlying consistent pulse, a musical idea can still toy with related ideas like *pacing* to generate motion and tension. By moving from slow to fast or suddenly shifting the momentum, free rhythm can generate a powerful feeling of rhythmic direction.

### Grouping beats

Even when the pulse is fairly consistent, we don't hear music as a steady stream of even sounds. It's possible to intentionally give that sensation of mechanical consistency to listeners, but usually we hear and feel weight in different places as we find patterns by grouping beats together. These groupings comprise the concept of *meter*, though that term can be tied into music notation in ways that are not always helpful. Like so much else here, these are easier to hear or feel than they are to describe.

Most groupings are either sets that are multiples of two (*duple*) or three (*triple*). They can be combined to make innumerable other possibilities. They can also both happen at once. Most popular music is duple: rhythmic patterns like the ones described above overlay a pulse of evenly grouped beats. That does not mean that we all hear the same duple groupings: I might hear groups of 4 quick beats where you hear 2 slow ones. Unless you are trying to write music down, that distinction is unimportant. Here is the earlier loop with claps happening at a different rate. They divide the pulse differently, but they are both duple.

```
D - T D D - T -
C - C - C - C -
C - - - C - - -
```

Each group is called a *measure* or *bar* and where those measures start and end can be arbitrary. In the above example, someone could feal each iteration as one bar or made up of two shorter ones.

Triple groupings *feel* different. Here is an example from the American old time fiddling tradition as performed by Tommy Jarrell, an influential fiddle player. Try counting "one, two, three, one, two, three..." as he plays. A lifting or lilting sensation is at the core of many triple meter pieces, in part because of the dance steps that the music accompanies.

If the pace quickens, though, we might feel the central pulse at a different place. This short sample of an Irish jig a patting sound that marks the beat. Counting "one, two, three" fast fits well, but a dancer cannot move her feet at that speed. Instead, you step to a slower "one, two." Here the pulse shifts and a division of the beat itself becomes clear. That will be the focus of a later section.

["The Short Grass Jig" by Wendy MacIsaac, Jackie Dunn MacIsaac](https://folkways.si.edu/wendy-macisaac-fiddle-jackie-dunn-macisaac-piano/the-short-grassjig/the-braes-of-elchies-jig/traditional-jig/gallaghers-jig/the-pibroch-of-odonal-dubh/celtic-old-time-world/music/track/smithsonian)

We can also add sets of duple or triple groupings to make more complicated ones. Arabic music has a classical form called *samaʿi* that is technically ten beats. In practice, however, it is a group of three beats followed by a group of four (or two pairs), and then another group of three.

```
samaʿi with counting, maybe a 4 screen video with counting, riqq, violin, oud?
Or an audio with a diagram
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
[   ] [     ] [   ]
```

These groupings can appear in ways that foster ambiguity for the listener to generate tension or space. Rhythms can spread over time in a way that emphasizes two or more different pulses simultaneously. This displacement can be troubling or exciting. Stephen Friedson argues that it opens the body to an experience of trance (1996). Ann Danielsen describes how the guitar groove in James Brown's famous song "Sex Machine" creates its own pulse that is slightly offset from the main one followed by the rest of the band (2006). While it does not bring about trance, it gives life to funk. In either case, a similar musical practice impacts the listener in a contextually-defined way, but both change our perception (Becker 2004).

Listen to this example and clap along to the pulse that you hear. Then unmute the first given pulse to see if it aligns with what you felt. Mute it again and try the second one. Then, if you are up to the challenge, try shifting your perception from one to the other and back, either with the pulse audio samples muted or unmuted. At first, it might feel unnatural. Eventually, and with familiarity, it may get easier.

```

PULSE 2 (MUTED)

## Dividing time

Just as beats are organized into larger groups (measures), they are divided into smaller parts. Of all of the rhythmic concepts discussed here, this might be the one where notational practices in western tradition struggles the most to depict the sounds that we hear. Sounds that land between beats rarely come at mathematically consistent intervals. Instead, a musician's expressivity will push a note just before or after, making it subtly early or late.

The consistent division of beats that creates an expectation for listeners is called the *subdivision*. The nudges that happen in practice usually go unspoken, but some analysts and music theorists call it *microtiming*. Subdivisions are somewhat straightforward to talk about. Microtiming involves a level of nuance that can be far more difficult to articulate.

In western music theory practice, subdivision is generally taught as *duple* or *triple*, just like meter and measures (the larger grouping of beats). A duple subdivision divides each beat into two even halves or some other multiple of two (like four quarters). A triple subdivision divides them into three. This concept relates to the larger groupings by taking the pulse as a basis and either grouping or dividing individual beats. None of these have to be made explicit in the music: they are structures we perceive as listeners that help us to comprehend musical sounds.

The following examples present these structures as connected levels of organization. While the music loops, you can mute or unmute the different scopes (the pulse, the grouping of beats, and the division of beats) to hear what each articulates.

```

### Playing with subdivisions

This conceptual structure of divisions serves as a groundwork for what a musician or ensemble actually does in practice. *Swing* is one common example of this that developed as part of the early jazz scene in the United States before the word came to represent its own genre of music. In swing, a duple subdivision turns into something else: the musicians lengthen the first half of the subdivision and shorten the second half. This means that they are no longer halves. A frequent division is for the first "half" to be roughly two-thirds of the length of the beat, leaving one-third for the second "half." This particular division turns into a mathematical *triple* subdivision where the first two thirds are linked together and roughly aligns with another name: a *shuffle*.

```
BEAT .     .     .     .     .     .
DUP  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
TRI  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
SWI  .   . .   . .   . .   . .   . .
```

This example from Odetta is a slow shuffle, which brings it closer to the sound of the blues.

Musicians do not typically adhere to mathematical certainties, though. They can and do, but they make use of the flexibility that live performance offers.[^computers] Swing performers themselves vary the degree of their swing to create an individual style. Even within a single musical line, they change the ratios of their subdivisions to build and release tension (Benadon 2006). Christine Gerischer shares similar ideas about Brazilian samba music, showing that this is not unique to the genre known as "swing" (2006). These manipulations are examples of *microtiming*, adjusting the timing of notes in slight, but noticeable, ways.

[^computers]: It should be said that flexibility in subdivisions and other expressive techniques are not exclusive to human performers. Electronic music has this capability and, in some cases, can do so with more specific intentionality on the part of the composer or producer than a live performer.

These adjustments can sound and feel different. As a basic demonstration, move the slider to change the subdivision ratio and listen to how the simple swing drum set beat responds.

```
SLIDER
RIDE (swung)
SNARE
BASS DRUM
```

This technique of rushing or delaying notes can happen anywhere in a piece of music, but it is a matter of balance. Breaking too far from expectations or norms could confuse a listener or dancer, but sticking to them methodically might get dull. One of my own favorite moments that exemplifies this is from [a performance of "Watermelon Man" by Mongo Santamaria](https://www.youtube.com/embed/zJuX-JJ8WF0). While listening, try to let yourself feel the groove and, if the music inspires you, move along with it or clap. Then, *feel* how the percussion (drum set and other instruments) almost pull the horn section (the brass instruments and saxophone) along. It is even more extreme when the percussion drops out at about 30 seconds in. When I listen, I can't help but to actually feel this tension in my body, as well as the relief that comes when they snap back together.

The final section turns to Morocco for a series of rhythms that challenge expectations by combining each of these practices.

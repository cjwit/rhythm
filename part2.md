## Part 2: Cycles, grooves, and time

We can divide time into pieces, both small and large. Seconds or minutes move quickly when compared to hours, days, and weeks. We can count seconds, but we feel hours passing differently. We generally use sleep to mark days and weather or larger cycles tell us about passing months or years. The same is true for music. While writing music down on paper forces us to measure things in certain ways, those methods don't necessarily align with how we feel sound's temporal momentum.

Western classical music, as it is often taught in schools, focuses on grouping smaller divisions of time to create *measures*, also called *bars*. These are called *beats*, adding another use of that term. Most musics around the world, including many European and American styles, use rhythmic cycles to orient the listener. The rock beat from earlier shows this: within much popular music, the cyclic repetitions provide momentum and stability while the subtle variations (like those in the dance club) manipulate that stability to create anticipation. This is one reason why popular music can be criticized as "mechanical"[^Adorno], but it's also one of the reasons why it is accessible and engaging.

These cycles even have names: a high school jazz band percussionist may get sheet music with a small label in the upper left hand corner that says "samba," "funk," "rock," or "bossa nova." These terms refer to adaptable patterns that someone might learn as they improve at the drum set. They play this cyclic pattern ("lay down the beat," perhaps) and provide a foundation for the rest of the ensemble. The player is not a machine, though. She will incorporate nuances and changes to match other things that are happening in other parts of the ensemble or to toy with the energy level of the performance. The pattern ("funk" or "bossa") is a skeletal guide.[^notation]

In many Middle Eastern musical styles, these patterns have similar names, each with its own history, appropriate place, and connotation. Johnny Farraj and Sami Abu Shumays describe many of them in *Inside Arab Music*, but they also outline a selection on their website: [maqamworld.com](http://www.maqamworld.com/en/iqaa.php). These patterns, collectively called *iqa'at*, are made of up two general types of drum strokes (or other sounds): *dum* signifies a lower, heavier sound while *tek* is usually higher or lighter. Maqamworld.com uses the letters D and T to show these, with S signifying a pause or silence. Take a moment to listen to the ways in which some of these cycles work in different pieces: [the iqa' called *maqsum*](http://www.maqamworld.com/en/iqaa/maqsum.php) is a popular one to start with. [The examples for *ayyoub*](http://www.maqamworld.com/en/iqaa/ayyub.php) show a huge diversity of stylistic range within one pattern. Some, like [*zaffa*](http://www.maqamworld.com/en/iqaa/zaffa.php) are specifically linked to certain traditions, in this case a wedding procession, even though they now appear in other styles and contexts. Listening to a symphony orchestra presenting popular music, as when [a group like Black Violin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb5zO7OybPg) incorporates hip hop beats into classical chamber music contexts, gives an idea of how a rhythmic pattern (a funky hip hop beat) can hold its identity in a seemingly unrelated context (on the violin and in classical music halls).

### Layers of interaction

Cyclic rhythmic patterns can grow and adapt in many ways. One is through improvisation: a musician can subtly change the placement of certain sounds, add new ones, or remove a few parts of the rhythm to regulate energy. "Regulate" sounds so sterile, it's about getting a crowd hype or making them hold their collective breath in anticipation. Groups of people can work together to do the same. If you have ever clapped along to a piece or changed how you move your feet while dancing, you were co-creating a pattern. This happens when, at a concert, everyone starts jumping together or swaying from side to side, cell phone flashlights held high. Rhythm can draw people in and together.

Another form of adaptation is layering. A technical term for a repeating rhythmic pattern is an *ostinato*. When one of these ostinatos (rhythmic cycles) appears alongside another, they can combine to create something identifiably new. This is how a drum set works. A pattern on a bass drum appears alongside a second one on a snare drum, perhaps a third on a high hat cymbal, and others on floor toms, larger cymbals, or other instruments to create an intricate groove.

A simple example from my own research in Morocco demonstrates this well (Witulski 2019). This is a pattern that appears in much popular music, but I crossed paths with it when researching a sacred ritual tradition as practiced by the *平issawa* brotherhood.[^issawa] It is part of a Muslim trance ceremony that involves prayer, devotional singing, and plenty of dancing and fun. This rhythm animates the moments where the musical ensemble invites laughter and popular religious songs into a long night of prayer and healing. The rhythmic pattern that I want to focus on also appears in a tradition of sung poetry called *malhun* that includes both "sacred" texts and "secular" ones.

In *平issawa* contexts, this pattern shows up on a pair of clay drums that are tied together. Some artists have switched from these traditional drums, however, to use manufactured *timbales*. In both cases, a larger and smaller drum makes two distinct sounds: one is lower and the other is higher. In *malhun*, different musicians each have small handheld goblet-shaped drums. Each one, called a *tar平ija* has a slightly different sound because of the natural fish-skin head.

These pairs of drums articulate two patterns. The first is two notes, equally spaced. This usually shows up on the larger drum. The second is offset and the notes are unequally spaced. In live settings, people might clap along to one or the other patterns. Try listening to each and clapping along with it individually.

```
BUTTONS: Play, Loop? Then show pattern with moving line?
P1 BUTTON WITH VISUAL: D - - - D - - -
P2 BUTTON WITH VISUAL: - - - T - - T -
```

Combining the two patterns changes the feel. They integrate into a single idea, yet people still clap along to the individual parts. Try identifying and clapping the distinct patterns when listening to the two of them together. Then, mute one and attempt to carry on the other.

```
BUTTONS: Loop, show both patterns, mute or quiet buttons for each
```

These are pretty mechanical examples. Real people making music will make other changes as well. The music speeds up as it gets closer to the climactic ending of a section or poem. As it speeds up, musicians will slightly adjust the relationships between the two patterns. They might make the last note of the second (offset) pattern louder to push listeners back to the beginning of the cycle in a way that you can feel when you move. They might squeeze the two middle notes, which are already close together, even tighter to make the music feel rushed or excited. These details are the subject of Part 3.

[^Adorno]: TODO Criticisms and citations of mechanical popular music

[^notation]: This way of thinking about how to organize time in music differs from how rhythm and a concept called *meter* are taught in many music classrooms. Where this approach follows the way people make, listen to, and feel music in many contexts across the world (including Europe in Europe and the United States and in classical music traditions), the teaching of rhythm and meter often focuses on quasi-mathematical procedures that relate to written musical notation. Notation is important for a number of reasons, but there is much that it does not represent well, including nuances in rhythm that change the "feel" of a pattern (TODO: cite issues). As seen in the maqamworld.com examples above, musicians globally can use western notational techniques as a tool to represent sound, but they recognize its failures and it rarely shows up in performance. This, again, is true in "the west": innumerable outstanding musicians never needed to learn to read music to wield it powerfully. Notation is an abstraction that can serve a purpose (namely, it can preserve and transmit some elements of sound for distribution, analysis, or similar goals). Also relevant is the fact that there are many other representational systems available to musicians and listeners, not only the one that has roots in European classical traditions (TODO: citations of other systems).

[^issawa]: In this case, the term "brotherhood" refers to the all male musical ensembles who carry out ritual ceremonies. The events themselves are usually open to client families (who require healing through sacred blessing) and their friends. There are other rituals within the tradition that happen in religious spaces and are differentiated by gender.

## To do

### Next

* Examples
  * Less margin between boxes on small (need to recalculate somehow)
  * Hide individual rows instead of all sections (examples 2 and 3)
  * Fix spacing on hidden rows (example 2), probably by removing the boxRows element
  * Mark a specific element (probably via javascript, hard coded: loop up example number, find child of child, and add styling to it)

### Code

* Add goatcounter and split out CSS (since this has multiple pages now)
* Determine overall look
* Set up color variables for easy changes later
* Try using objects to organize the code
  * Frame (title)
  * Box layout
  * Wave form layout
  * Play and loop buttons
  * Text description
  * Audio object?
